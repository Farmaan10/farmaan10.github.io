## Research Projects

1. **News Aggregator with GenAI Chatbot** (Python, OpenAI API, GitHub Actions)  
   - **Description:** Developed Flask-based web application to ingest, summarise, and categorise 500+ Australian news articles weekly into finance, lifestyle, sports, and music domains. Built Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with OpenAI GPT-4.1 and embedding-based retrieval to power the responsive news chatbot. Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions and deployed on Render, attained 99.3% uptime, while ensuring secure API key management.

2. **Optimising the semi-Markov Model approach for Performance Analysis** (Python)  
   - **Description:** Optimised the discovery of process models, realising 1.35x speed improvement through CPU parallelism. Enhanced numerical operations, leading to 3x faster functions. Researched and optimised hyperparameter usage, improving the KL Divergence metric by 2.54% through systematic tuning and evaluation. Developed GPU-based parallelism foundations to enable further performance gain and support the processing of larger event logs.

3. **Hybrid Models for Stock News Sentiment Analysis** (Python, Telegram API)  
   - **Description:** Accumulated more than 1.4 million financial headlines from Kaggle datasets. Compared Lexicon-based and Learning-based models for financial news sentiment analysis. Built a Hybrid Model, combining Harvard IV-4 with a Multi-Layer Perceptron, achieving an accuracy of 99.56%, used to assign polarity to financial news headlines. Deployed as a Telegram ChatBot sharing information using API keys via the Heroku cloud platform, providing users with recent market sentiments of stocks.

4. **Spotifyâ€™s Song Genre Prediction** (R Programming)  
   - **Description:** Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, identifying critical song features for each genre. Transformed features to remove skewness and reduced dimensions to 13 using Principal Component Analysis due to correlated features. Tuned the hyperparameters, validated the performance of multinomial classifiers and tested the trained models. Random Forest Classifier outperformed LDA and KNN Classifier, having an AUC of 0.8178.
